# Fuzzing (aura-security)

The `aura-security` crate ships a cargo-fuzz harness at `crates/security/fuzz/`
with targets for the injection detector, leak detector, sensitive-path check,
AES-GCM crypto roundtrip, and placeholder minter. The fuzz crate is excluded
from the workspace; run from inside `crates/security/`:

```bash
cargo install cargo-fuzz                                       # one-time
rustup install nightly                                         # libFuzzer needs nightly

cd crates/security
cargo +nightly fuzz list                                        # list targets
cargo +nightly fuzz run fuzz_injection_detector                 # run until crash/Ctrl-C
cargo +nightly fuzz run fuzz_leak_detector -- -max_total_time=300
```

Available targets: `fuzz_injection_detector`, `fuzz_leak_detector`,
`fuzz_sensitive_paths`, `fuzz_crypto_roundtrip`, `fuzz_placeholder`. Seed
corpora live under `crates/security/fuzz/corpus/<target>/`.
